      My mother had fallen outside and when I arrived she was on the line with Life Alert. The Life Alert Representative was so kind and stayed on the line with me the entire time until the ambulance arrived. She also talked with the 1st responders. I can’t say thank you enough for the help and kindness shown. Life Alert was so wonderful and I greatly appreciate everything they did.

      <p class="text_column"><b>Loretta from N. D., Placentia, CA wrote</b> Husband got tangled in bed covers and slid to the floor. I could not pick him up or move him. Told him to turn over onto his knees and grab the mattress and pull himself up. No good – so I called Life Alert and the young fellow arrived and 1-2-3 he was up and okay. The man from Life Alert was on the phone the complete time which made me feel better. Thanks!
