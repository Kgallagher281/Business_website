		<p><b>History of Life Alert</b><br>
		Life alert services date back to 1972 when a psychology professor called Dibner came up with an idea of helping the elderly get emergency help even when they could not get to their telephones. Dibner thought that such a device would save many seniors’ lives by getting them the help they need as soon as their distress cry gets to people who can offer help. In 1974, the professor started the process of obtaining a patent. He was awarded the patent in 1976 and is to this day seen as the father of medical alert services in the United States.</p><br>

		<p><b>Company Services</b><br>
        <p>Life Alert ® is a Personal Emergency Response and Home Medical Alert System company that saves lives from catastrophic outcomes, using a unique technology to provide superior home audio monitoring protection. Founded in 1987, Life Alert ® provides its service to members nationwide. The company employs over 600 people, all in the United States.</p>

		<p>The company’s service solves a major home security issue. Life Alert’s protection helps people to live at home with independence and comfort, living their lives the way they want to, with a feeling of safety and peace of mind.</p><br>

        <p>Life Alert ® handles over two million calls a year, and on average saves at least one life from a potential catastrophic* outcome every 11 minutes (over 46,000 in 2016). In Life Alert’s Monitoring Center, the size of its emergency staff per member is 200% greater than a traditional security company.</p><br>

        <p>Thanks to a greater sense of security, a 2004 ACNielsen study showed that 87% of Life Alert ® members stated that Life Alert’s protection is a main or important factor in their decision to keep on living alone at home. For safety, security and emergency protection, Life Alert ® is the choice for all ages.</p> <br>
